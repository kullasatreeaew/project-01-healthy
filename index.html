                  Oats are among the healthiest grains on earth. They’re a
                  gluten-free whole grain and a great source of important
                  vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants. Studies show that
                  oats and oatmeal have many health benefits. These include
                  weight loss, lower blood sugar levels, and a reduced risk of
                  heart disease.

      <div class="modal-body">
          <p>Oat groats, the most intact and whole form of oats, take a long time to cook. For this reason, most people prefer rolled, crushed, or steel-cut oats.</p>
          <p>Instant (quick) oats are the most highly processed variety. While they take the shortest time to cook, the texture may be mushy.Oats are commonly eaten for breakfast as oatmeal, which is made by boiling oats in water or milk. Oatmeal is often referred to as porridge.They’re also often included in muffins, granola bars, cookies, and other baked goods.</p>
        <h5><b>1. Oats are incredibly nutritious</b></h5>
        <p>The nutrient composition of oats is well-balanced. They are a good source of carbs and fiber, including the powerful fiber beta-glucan</p>
        <p>They are also a good source of high quality protein, with a good balance of essential amino acids. Oats are loaded with important vitamins, minerals, and antioxidant plant compounds. Half a cup (78 grams) of dry oats contains.</p>

        <h5><b>2. Whole oats are rich in antioxidants, including avenanthramides</b></h5>
        <p>Whole oats are high in antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds called polyphenols. Most notable is a unique group of antioxidants called avenanthramides, which are almost solely found in oats</p>
        <p>Both old and newer research has found that avenanthramides may help lower blood pressure levels by increasing the production of nitric oxide. This gas molecule helps dilate (widen) blood vessels and leads to better blood flow</p>
        
        <h5><b>3. Oats contain a powerful soluble fiber called beta-glucan</b></h5>
        <p>Oats contain large amounts of beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber. Beta-glucan partially dissolves in water and forms a thick, gel-like solution in your gut.</p>
        
        <h5><b>4. They can lower cholesterol levels and protect LDL cholesterol from damage</b></h5>
        <p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. One major risk factor is high blood cholesterol. Many studies have shown that the beta-glucan fiber in oats is effective at reducing both total and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels</p>
        <p>Beta-glucan may increase the release of cholesterol-rich bile, which reduces the circulating levels of cholesterol in your blood.</p>

        <h5><b>5. Oats can improve blood sugar control</b></h5>
        <p>Type 2 diabetes is a common health condition, characterized by significantly elevated blood sugars. It usually results from decreased sensitivity to the hormone insulin.</p>
        <p>Oats may help lower blood sugar levels, especially in people with overweight or who have type 2 diabetes. The beta-glucan in both oats and barley may also improve insulin sensitivity</p>

        <h5><b>6. Oatmeal is very filling and may help you lose weight</b></h5>
        <p>Not only is oatmeal (porridge) a delicious breakfast food, it’s also very filling. Eating filling foods may help you eat fewer calories and lose weight. By delaying the time it takes your stomach to empty of food, the beta-glucan in oatmeal may increase your feeling of fullness.</p>

        <h5><b>7. Finely ground oats may help with skin care</b></h5>
        <p>It’s no coincidence that oats can be found in numerous skin care products. Makers of these products often label finely ground oats as “colloidal oatmeal.”</p>

        <h5><b>8. They may decrease the risk of childhood asthma</b></h5>
        <p>Asthma is the most common chronic condition in kids. It’s an inflammatory disorder of the airways — the tubes that carry air to and from a person’s lungs. Although not all children have the same symptoms, many experience recurrent coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.</p>

        <h5><b>9. Oats may help relieve constipation</b></h5>
        <p>People of all ages and populations experience constipation. This refers to infrequent, irregular bowel movements that are difficult to pass. Studies indicate that oat bran, the fiber-rich outer layer of the grain, may help relieve constipation in older adults</p>

                  Berries are small, soft, round fruit of various colors -
                  mainly blue, red, or purple. They’re sweet or sour in taste
                  and are often used in preserves, jams, and desserts. Berries
                  tend to have a good nutritional profile. They’re typically
                  high in fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidant polyphenols. As a
                  result, incorporating berries into your diet may help prevent
                  and reduce symptoms of many chronic diseases.

        <p>Blueberries are popular berries that serve as a great source of vitamin K. Blueberries also contain antioxidant polyphenols called anthocyanins.</p>

        <h5><b>2. Raspberries</b></h5>
        <p>Raspberries are often used in desserts and are a very good source of fiber. Raspberries also contain antioxidant polyphenols called ellagitannins, which can help reduce oxidative stress.</p>

        <h5><b>3. Goji berries</b></h5>
        <p>Goji berries, also known as wolfberries, are native to China and used in traditional medicine. They have recently become very popular in the Western world. Goji berries also contain high levels of vitamin A and zeaxanthin, both of which are important for eye health.</p>

        <h5><b>4. Strawberries</b></h5>
        <p>Strawberries are one of the most commonly consumed berries in the world and also one of the best sources of vitamin C.</p>
        <p>Strawberries are good for heart health. In fact, a study of more than 93,000 women found that those who ate more than 3 servings of strawberries and blueberries per week had over a 30% lower risk of heart attack.</p>

        <h5><b>5. Bilberries</b></h5>
        <p>Bilberries are very similar to blueberries, so the two are often confused. Bilberries are native to Europe, whereas blueberries are native to North America.</p>
        <p>Some have suggested that eating bilberries or drinking bilberry juice can reduce inflammation in people at risk of heart disease or metabolic syndrome.</p>

        <h5><b>6. Açaí berries</b></h5>
        <p>Açaí berries grow on açaíi palm trees native to the Brazilian Amazon region. They have become popular health food supplements because of their high antioxidant content. Açaí berries are one of the best sources of antioxidant polyphenols and may contain as much as 10 times more antioxidants than blueberries.</p>

        <h5><b>7. Cranberries</b></h5>
        <p>Cranberries are an extremely healthy fruit with a tart taste. That’s why they’re rarely eaten raw. Instead, they are commonly consumed as juice or as cranberry sauce.</p>
        <p>However, they’re primarily consumed as a beverage, and most of these antioxidants are lost in the process of turning them into a juice. So, cranberry juice doesn’t contain as many polyphenols as raw cranberries.</p>

        <h5><b>8. Grapes</b></h5>
        <p>Grapes are widely consumed either as whole raw fruit or in the form of juice, wine, raisins, or vinegar.</p>
        <p>The skin and seeds of grapes are an excellent source of antioxidant polyphenols. Studies have shown that grape seed polyphenol extracts can lower both blood pressure and heart rate.</p>

      <p>Chamomile tea is a popular beverage that also offers a variety of health benefits. Chamomile is an herb that comes from the daisy-like flowers of the Asteraceae plant family. It has been consumed for centuries as a natural remedy for several health conditions. To make chamomile tea, the flowers are dried and then infused into hot water.</p>
      <p>Many people enjoy chamomile tea as a caffeine-free alternative to black or green tea and for its earthy, somewhat sweet taste. Furthermore, chamomile tea is loaded with antioxidants that may play a role in lowering your risk of several diseases, including heart disease and cancer. Chamomile has properties that may aid sleep and digestion, as well.</p>
        
      <h5><b>1. May Improve Sleep Quality</b></h5>
      <p>Chamomile has some unique properties that may benefit the quality of your sleep. It contains apigenin, an antioxidant that binds to certain receptors in your brain that may promote sleepiness and reduce insomnia, or the chronic inability to sleep.</p>

      <h5><b>2. May Promote Digestive Health</b></h5>
      <p>Proper digestion is extremely important for your overall health. Limited evidence suggests chamomile may be effective for promoting better digestion by reducing the risk of certain gastrointestinal conditions.</p>
      <p>A few studies have found that chamomile extract has the potential to protect against diarrhea in mice. This is attributed to its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
      
      <h5><b>3. May Protect Against Certain Types of Cancer</b></h5>
      <p>The antioxidants found in chamomile tea have been linked with a lower incidence of certain types of cancer.</p>

      <h5><b>4. May Benefit Blood Sugar Control</b></h5>
      <p>Drinking chamomile tea may aid in lowering blood sugar levels. Its anti-inflammatory properties may prevent damage to the cells of your pancreas, which occurs when your blood sugar levels are chronically elevated.</p>

      <h5><b>5. May Improve Heart Health</b></h5>
      <p>Chamomile tea is abundant in flavones, a class of antioxidants. Flavones have been studied for their potential to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which are important markers of your heart disease risk.</p>
